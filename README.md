üöÄ About The Project
WeathrIQ is more than just a weather app. It's a full-stack web application demonstrating the integration of a robust Django backend with a dynamic, visually appealing frontend. The project leverages machine learning models to provide not just current weather data, but also insightful predictions for future conditions.

From live weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API to AI-powered rain predictions, WeathrIQ is designed to be both functional and beautiful.

üåü Core Features
Live Weather Data: Fetches up-to-the-minute weather conditions for any city in the world.

5-Hour Future Forecast: Uses AI to predict temperature and humidity for the next five hours.

AI-Powered Rain Prediction: A trained RandomForestClassifier predicts the likelihood of rain for the following day.

Dynamic & Immersive UI: The interface background and elements change based on the current weather, providing a unique experience for each location.

Interactive Data Visualization: Hourly forecast data is beautifully rendered using Chart.js.

Responsive Design: Looks and works great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
